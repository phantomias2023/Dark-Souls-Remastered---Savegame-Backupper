# Dark-Souls-Remastered---Savegame-Backupper
Version 0.2a 

Simple Program that backups the DS:R savegame in a given interval. 
Just start the program and the savegame should be detected automatically - if not,
choose it.

Backup interval can be set from 1 to 90 minutes. 

There can be unlimited backups (could clutter the drive)  or a number from 1 to 10.

The program is nothing fancy and pretty self explanatory. Backups have a time-and datestamp
in their file extension. To roll back to an old save, simply delete the added extension and 
copy it into your DS:R savegame directory - overwriting your current savegame.
